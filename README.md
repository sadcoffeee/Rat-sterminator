# Rat-sterminator
Full Unity project folder for a game I made. Check out the [itch page](https://sadcoffeee.itch.io/rat-sterminator) to try it out :-)

To open and modify for yourself, clone this repository, open Unity Hub, click Add & then select the cloned folder.

Made with Editor version 2022.3.11f1, open on other versions at your own risk.

I'll just be honest and warn that the project files aren't exactly managed beautifully ðŸ˜‚ but if you're curious how I implemented something from the game feel free to dig through the scenes & code to find out. Alternatively I'm always reachable on Discord @pan_vr
